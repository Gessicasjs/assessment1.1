```
#1

### Load dataset and name it as  dinner.

```{r}

dinner <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv")

```
### Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using RMarkdown

```{r 10 rows}
dinner %>% head(10) %>% 
  kable()
```
#2

### Use fct_reorder and parse_number functions to create a factor variable family_income

```{r }
dinner <- dinner %>%
       mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income)))

```
#3

### Generate the general statistics of the dataset using `summary()` and `skim()` function

```{r }

skim(dinner) %>% 
  kable()
summary(dinner) %>% 
  kable()


```
#4 

### What is the number of people who celebrate?

```{r}

dinner %>% filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>% 
count(celebrate, sort = TRUE)%>% 
  kable()


```
#5
#6
### What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?
### Create a data viz showing this in the most evident way. Provide your own legend and use themes.

```{r }

dinner %>%  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n,main_prep,fill = main_prep)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~main_dish) 
```
#7
### How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?

```{r}

dinner %>%  count(cranberry, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable()
dinner %>% filter(gravy == "Yes") %>% 
  count (gravy,sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() 
```

#8
#9
### What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges
### Present this information in the most evident way on the data viz.

```{r}

dinner %>% filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>%  
  count(family_income, celebrate, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, family_income, fill = n)) +
  geom_col()
```
#10

```{r }
pie <- dinner %>% 
  select(starts_with("pie"), -pie13) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(type == "pie9")
sides <- dinner %>% 
  select(starts_with("side")) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(type == "side9")
desserts <- dinner %>% 
  select(starts_with("dessert")) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>% na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(value != "None") %>% 
  filter(type == "dessert8")
```


#11
```{r}
commonfoods <- rbind(pie, sides, desserts) 
commonfoods %>% ggplot(aes(type, n, fill = value)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Type of Dish", y = "Number of people", title = "Most common Dessert, Pie,and Side", caption = "Image: Graph") +
  theme_test()
```


### 12. No Question given in the assignment.
### 13. How do the servings differ by income.
### 14. Present this information on a data viz.

```{r}
dinner %>% count(main_dish, family_income)%>%
  na.omit(main_dish)%>%
  na.omit(family_income)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill = family_income)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(family_income~.,)+
  coord_flip() +
   labs(x = "Main Dishes", y = "Number of people", title = "Servings Differ By Income", caption = "Image: Graph") +
  theme_test()
```
